        <h4>Washing the Basket Inside Your Room</h4>
        <p>Keeping the basket clean in your room is essential for maintaining a hygienic and organized space. Start by
          emptying the basket completely and taking it outside to shake off any loose dust or debris. For plastic or
          metal baskets, use warm, soapy water and a sponge to scrub the inside and outside thoroughly, ensuring all
          grime is removed. If your basket is made of fabric or wicker, vacuum the interior to lift dust, then wipe it
          down gently with a damp cloth and mild soap. Allow it to air dry fully to prevent mildew. Finish by spraying
          the basket with a disinfectant, letting it sit for a few minutes, and then wiping it down. Regular cleaning of
          the basket not only prolongs its lifespan but also helps keep your room fresh and clean.</p>

        <h4>Decluttering</h4>
        <p> Decluttering is a crucial step in creating a serene and organized living space. Begin by sorting your items
          into four categories: keep, donate, discard, and relocate. Tackling one small area at a time, such as a single
          drawer or shelf, can help prevent feelings of being overwhelmed. Use storage solutions like bins and
          organizers to neatly group similar items, making them easier to find and store. Immediately bag or box items
          for donation or disposal to avoid second-guessing your decisions. Regularly scheduled decluttering sessions
          will help maintain this organization, ensuring your room stays tidy and stress-free. </p>

        <h4>Tidy Up Before Bed</h4>
        <p>Tidying up before bed sets a positive tone for the next day and ensures a restful sleep environment. Start by
          making your bed, straightening sheets, and arranging pillows, which instantly makes the room look neater.
          Clear any clutter from surfaces like desks, nightstands, and dressers, putting items back in their designated
          spots. Deal with clothes by hanging up or folding clean ones and placing dirty laundry in the basket. Give the
          floor a quick sweep or vacuum to remove any dirt or debris that has accumulated during the day. Prepare for
          tomorrow by laying out your clothes and packing your bag, reducing morning stress. Finally, create a calming
          ambiance by dimming lights, lighting a candle, or using a diffuser,transforming your room into a tranquil
          retreat.</p>
