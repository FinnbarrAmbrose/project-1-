## Features

### Feature 1: Navigation Bar
- **Description:** The navigation bar directs users from the homepage to cooking, learning, and cleaning sections. It helps in traversing the website, allowing information to be separated into specific categories. Icons were made bolder and bigger to ensure ease of use, without compromising fit on a phone screen.
