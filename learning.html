        <h4>Stick to a Schedule</h2>
        <p>Sticking to a schedule is essential for effective learning and productivity. Create a detailed timetable that
          includes specific blocks of time dedicated to different subjects or tasks. Consistency helps your brain adapt
          to a routine, making it easier to concentrate and retain information. Use digital tools or a physical planner
          to track your schedule, setting reminders for start and end times of study sessions. Allocate time for reviews
          and revisions to reinforce what you've learned. By adhering to a structured schedule, you can ensure a
          balanced approach to your studies, avoid last-minute cramming, and achieve a sense of accomplishment and
          progress.</p>

        <h4>Practice with Your Own Projects</h4>
        <p>Practicing with your own projects is one of the most effective ways to deepen your understanding and apply
          what you've learned. Choose projects that interest you and are relevant to the skills you're trying to
          develop. For example, if you're learning to code, build a personal website or a small application. If you're
          studying a new language, write short stories or engage in conversations with native speakers. Working on
          personal projects allows you to experiment, make mistakes,and learn in a practical, hands-on way. It also
          provides a sense of ownership and accomplishment, making the learning process more enjoyable and meaningful.

        <h4>Take Regular Breaks</h4>
        <p> Taking regular breaks is crucial for maintaining focus and preventing burnout. The human brain can only
          sustain attention for a limited period, usually around 25-30 minutes. Implement techniques like the Pomodoro
          Technique, which involves working for a set period (e.g., 25 minutes) followed by a short break (e.g., 5
          minutes). During breaks, engage in activities that help you relax and recharge, such as stretching, walking,
          or deep breathing exercises. Avoid screen time during these breaks to give your eyes a rest. Regular intervals
          of focused work and rest can enhance your overall productivity and keep you motivated throughout your study
          sessions.</p>
